🧾 Live Network Packet Capture Report
🔍 Overview
This report summarizes live packet captures from a Wireshark session, filtered by protocol types to analyze traffic patterns, endpoints, and potential insights for network troubleshooting or cybersecurity monitoring.

1. 📡 HTTP Traffic Analysis
Filter Used: http
Key Observations:
- Source IP: 146.75.122.172 (likely a public-facing server)
- Destination IP: 10.167.32.91 (internal/private client)
- Protocol: HTTP over TCP (Port 80)
- Notable Packet:
- Packet No. 66 contains a GET request to a streaming service with a long URL and parameters, indicating media or content retrieval.
- Other Packets:
- Many labeled as Continuation, suggesting segmented HTTP payloads across multiple TCP packets.
Frame Details (Packet 4):
- Ethernet II: MAC addresses of client and server
- IP Layer: IPv4 communication
- TCP Layer:
- Source Port: 80
- Destination Port: 18734
- Sequence and Acknowledgment numbers indicate active session
- Payload: HTTP content visible in ASCII and hex
Interpretation:
This traffic likely represents a media stream or web content being accessed by the client. The continuation packets suggest large data transfer, possibly video or file download.

2. 🌐 DNS Traffic Analysis
Filter Used: dns
Key Observations:
- Source IP: 10.167.32.91
- Destination IP: 10.167.32.90
- Protocol: DNS over UDP (Port 53)
- Queried Domains:
- outlook.office365.com
- optimizationguide-pa.googleapis.com
- collector.bsg.brave.com
- msedge.api.cdp.microsoft.com
Frame Details (Packet 1279):
- Ethernet II: MAC addresses of local devices
- IP Layer: IPv4
- UDP Layer:
- Source Port: 55106
- Destination Port: 53
- DNS Layer: Query type
Interpretation:
The client is actively resolving domain names for Microsoft, Google, Brave, and Edge services. This indicates browser activity, telemetry, or background service communication.

3. 🔒 TCP Traffic Analysis
Filter Used: tcp
Key Observations:
- Source IP: 2409:40f4:314a:5a5f:... (IPv6)
- Destination IP: 2600:140f:400::b854:e9 (IPv6)
- Protocol: TCP over IPv6
- Ports:
- Source Port: 54184
- Destination Port: 443 (HTTPS)
- Flags: ACK
- Stream Index: 31 (first packet in stream)
Frame Details (Packet 128):
- TCP Segment Length: 1 byte
- Sequence & Acknowledgment Numbers:
- Seq: 4211552233
- Ack: 3126732339
- Window Size: 251
Interpretation:
This packet is part of an HTTPS session, likely encrypted. The ACK flag and minimal payload suggest session establishment or keep-alive behavior.


Recommendations:
- Monitor HTTP GET requests for unusual URLs or payloads.
- Review DNS queries for suspicious domains.
- Correlate TCP streams with application behavior for anomaly detection.
