# TASK-5-Capture-live-network-packets

📌 Objective


The goal of this project is to capture real‑time network traffic on a Windows 10 system using Wireshark,
examine the packets being transmitted, identify common network protocols, 
and save the captured data for further analysis.

🛠 Tools Utilized

- Wireshark 3.2.1 (64‑bit)
- Npcap (running in WinPcap compatibility mode)
- Windows 10 (Build 10240)

📋 Activities Completed
- Successfully installed Wireshark and its required packet‑capture driver.
- Initiated a live capture session on the primary network adapter (Wi‑Fi or Ethernet).
- Generated network activity by visiting websites and executing ping commands.
- Stopped the capture after approximately one minute of traffic collection.
- Applied protocol‑specific display filters to isolate different types of packets.
- Detected and examined multiple protocols, including:
- DNS
- TCP
- HTTP
- Reviewed packet attributes such as IP addresses, protocol type, frame size, and communication flow.
- Saved the captured traffic in .pcap format for offline inspection.

🔍 Protocols Observed
- DNS: Used for translating domain names into corresponding IP addresses.
- TCP: Ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data between devices.
- HTTP: Facilitates communication between web clients and servers.

📁 Included Files
- wireshark_capture.pcap – The recorded packet capture file
- README.md – Documentation outlining the process and findings

✅ Conclusion
This exercise provides a foundational understanding of how Wireshark captures and displays network traffic. By examining real packets and identifying key protocols, the project offers valuable insight into how data travels across a network at the packet level.

If you want, I can also create a more technical, more beginner‑friendly, or more professional version depending on your GitHub style.
